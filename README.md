## ✨ What Makes This Special?

This isn't just a menu website. It's a **complete end-to-end restaurant ecosystem** with separate dashboards for every role — Customers, Admins, Kitchen Staff, and Delivery Partners — all syncing in real-time via Firebase.

---

## 🗺️ System Architecture

```
Customer  →  Places Order  →  Admin Dashboard  →  Kitchen Display  →  Delivery  →  OTP Confirm  →  ⭐ Review
```

| Role | Dashboard | What They Do |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| 👤 **Customer** | `index.html`, `menu.html`, `orders.html` | Browse, order, track, pay, rate |
| 🛡️ **Admin** | `admin.html` | Accept orders, manage flow, view revenue |
| 👨‍🍳 **Kitchen** | `kitchen.html` | See live tickets, mark food ready |
| 🛵 **Delivery** | `delivery.html` | Accept deliveries, confirm via OTP |
