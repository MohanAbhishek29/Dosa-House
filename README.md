# 🥥 Dosa House - Authentic South Indian Cuisine

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **Dosa House**. I built this project to prototype a complete, responsive frontend for a South Indian restaurant. I wanted to practice creating a smooth, modern user experience using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without relying on heavy frameworks. It's a fun way to showcase my frontend development skills and my love for authentic food!

## 🌟 Features

### 🍛 Core Experience
-   **Dynamic Menu**: Browse through Dosas, Idlis, Vadas, and more. I added real-time category filtering to make navigation easy.
-   **Simple Search**: A search bar lets you quickly find specific dishes (like typing "Masala" or "Paneer").
-   **Interactive Cart**: You can add items to your cart, change quantities, and watch the total bill update instantly.
-   **Order Tracking**: Place an order and watch its simulated status change from **Pending** → **Preparing** → **Delivered**.

### 📅 Advanced Functionality
-   **Table Booking**: I built a custom booking form that actually works locally by saving your reservation to `localStorage`.
-   **User Reviews**: You can read existing feedback or even write your own test review!
    -   *Try it:* Click "Write a Review" on the home page to test the modal and star rating logic I wrote.
-   **Order History**: Check your past orders. They stick around even after you close the browser, mimicking a real backend using browser storage.
    -   *Testing:* There's a "Clear History" button on the Orders page if you want to start fresh.

### 🎨 Visual Polish
-   **Glassmorphism UI**: I experimented with a modern glass effect using colors inspired by South Indian culture (Saffron, Banana Leaf Green, Clay Pot Brown).
-   **Fun CSS Effects**: I added a "steaming hot" animation when you hover over menu items just to give it some life.
-   **Smooth Interactions**: Button hovers and page transitions are mapped out to feel natural and responsive.
